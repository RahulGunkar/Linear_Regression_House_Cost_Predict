# Linear_Regression_House_Cost_Predict
This repository contains the code for LINEAR REGRESSION.
Aim of this repository is to explain the linear regression model for both multi-variate and single variate system.

It has codes for linear regression with only numpy, with using sklearn ,with tensorflow and with keras.
It also contains code for various gradient descent for multi-variate system.
